# Project 11: What to Wear React Project

Welcome to the WTWR (What to Wear) React project! In this sprint, I focused on enhancing the web application by implementing a temperature unit toggle switch using React context and setting up a profile page route with React Router. I also handled form submissions with controlled components or refs and integrated a mock server to simulate API interactions. This setup helps with practicing state management, routing, and API communication. The updated application improves functionality and offers a more dynamic user experience.
